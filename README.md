# Facial Expression Recognition Using Deep Learning (9 Emotions)

This repository contains the implementation and experimental results of my **MATH 895 Research Project** at **San Francisco State University**, focused on building a **Facial Expression Recognition (FER)** system using deep learning.

The project evaluates and compares multiple architectures—including a **Custom CNN**, **VGG16 (Fine-Tuned)**, and **YOLOv8**—for classifying facial images into **nine emotion categories**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Facial expression recognition plays a crucial role in applications such as:
- Human–Computer Interaction
- Mental health assessment
- Surveillance and behavioral analysis
- Affective computing

The objective of this project is to identify a model that balances **accuracy, generalization, and inference efficiency** for real-world emotion recognition tasks.

## 😊 Emotion Classes

The models classify facial expressions into the following **9 emotions**:

- Angry  
- Contempt  
- Disgust  
- Fear  
- Ha
